# NumberToText
Convert very very large numbers to their true names.

This project was founded by Jonathan Wood, his original repo can be found here: [NumberToText](https://github.com/SoftCircuits/NumberToText) by @SoftCircuits.

I have recoded this project to allow for MUCH MUCH larger numbers.

Example: 2398^8397
